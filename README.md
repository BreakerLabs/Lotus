# The-Prime-Programming-Language
Prime is a type-safe compiled programming languages designed to simplify the syntax of C++ and achieving memory safety using ownership and borrowing.

The syntax of Prime is mainly C/C++ based however adding new features and "syntactic-sugar". The goal for the language is a more elegant approach to high-demands programming. In other words, Prime has a bias for systemsprogramming.

This repository contains the original compiler for Prime: Primec (Prime Compiler). It is not yet finished and offers minimal debugging support with unoptimized binary. It is incomplete, as can be said for the Prime SDL.
