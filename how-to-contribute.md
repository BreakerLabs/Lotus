# How to contribute

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

## Code of conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Open development

All work on this project happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Reporting issues

- If you find a bug, open an issue using the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
- If you find a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. Do not file a public issue but rather report it directly to the maintainers.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

Before submitting a bug report, ensure that you do the following:

1. Check the [FAQs](FAQ.md) for a list of common questions and problems.
2. Make sure you are using the latest Lotus version.
3. Check the existing [issues](https://github.com/Totem-Studios/Lotus/issues) to make sure you are not duplicating someone's work.

### Suggesting enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, create an issue using the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) or email us at **pontus@henriksson.space**.

### Your first code contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? Look for issues tagged `good-first-issue`.

### Pull requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. Ensure the test suite passes.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

### Code style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- You can try running `cpplint <filename>` for C++ files or `lotuslint <filename>` for lotus files for style unification. **[THE LOTUS LINTER IS CURRENTLY OUTDATED SO PLEASE DO NOT USE IT TO FORMAT THE LOTUS FILES!]**

## Additional notes

### Issue and pull request labels

Here are some labels we're using to better organize the GitHub issues:

- `bug`: For bug reporting
- `enhancement`: For feature requests
- `help-wanted`: For tasks that others can work on
