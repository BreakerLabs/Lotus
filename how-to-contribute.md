First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Open Development

All work on this project happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Reporting Issues

- If you find a bug, open an issue using the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
- If you find a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. Do not file a public issue but rather report it directly to the maintainers.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, ensure that you do the following:

1. Check the [FAQs](FAQ.md) for a list of common questions and problems.
2. Make sure you are using the latest Lotus version.
3. Check the existing [issues](https://github.com/Totem-Studios/Lotus/issues) to make sure you are not duplicating someone's work.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, create an issue using the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) or email us at **pontus@henriksson.space**.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? Look for issues tagged `good-first-issue`.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. Ensure the test suite passes.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- You can try running `cpplint <filename>` for c++ files or `lotuslint <filename>` for lotus files for style unification.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

Here are some labels we're using to better organize the GitHub issues:

- `bug`: For bug reporting
